# HighTechU Group Project 

HighTechU Spring 2019 - Group Project

### Please write the problem statement of your project.

Problem: Daily life for most people who play videogames is stressful and busy, and most readily-available popular videogames contain tension or stress-inducing elements.

### Mention the four user stories that your team has decided to work on.

### Please note that the roles assigned here have changed drastically since writing this.

Here are the things we decided to start with this week:
1.	User Story 1
-	As a user, I want a peaceful game so that I can relax during exam season. Art – Avery
2.	User Story 2
-	As a user, I want to be able to keep track of high scores so that I can compete with myself to get better at the game. – Owen 
3.	User Story 3
-	As a user, I want a distraction-free webpage so that I can focus on the game more. UI – Jonah  

4.	Menu + Title Screen – Leo (apologies if I got the name wrong, couldn’t read the handwriting)


### Design a wireframe for your project.

**Note** 

* You are free to draw it on paper or use any computer application such as Balsamic.
* Please create a seperate folder for this question. Name the folder 'wireframe' and then upload the file inside that folder.
