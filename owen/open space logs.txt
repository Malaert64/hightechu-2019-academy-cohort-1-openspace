Log auto-recovery The event horizon continues to expand, consuming worlds. What happens when I reach it?


Log auto-recovery My communications drift into the void, no answer. I don't know why I continue this ritual.


Log auto-recovery The derelict scavenger drones continue to follow me. Hunting scrap for masters long dead.


Log auto-recovery I have to reach the event horizon before them. I have to know the truth.


Log auto-recovery If we are truly alone in the universe, what follows me in the darkness?


Log auto-recovery The ship floats in space alone. A gleaming opal in a sea of inky water.


Log auto-recovery Even if i find my way back, is there anything left for me?


Log auto-recovery When I was young, shiphands told stories of Leviathans in the dark. I never used to believe them.


Log auto-recovery The ship feels so empty… I miss her.


Log auto-recovery I lost sol amongst the other shimmering stars. A trilon points of light are my only companions now.


Log auto-recovery I’m f****ng tired of the rations. At least my supply won't run out anytime soon
